Welcome to the NASA VEDA platform operated by NASA and targeted at selected user groups at NASA and partnering programs. Below are resources for users and content contributors.

While these resources are targeted at users of the NASA VEDA platform, many of the open-source approaches promoted here will also apply to other platforms built on VEDA open-source software or equivalent.

* Instructions for [ingesting data](./content-curation/dataset-ingestion/index.qmd) into VEDA Data Services
* How to [add and manage content](./content-curation/dashboard-configuration/index.qmd) on the VEDA Dashboard
* Using cloud-based [scientific computing resources](./scientific-computing/index.qmd)
* Example and tutorial [Jupyter notebooks](./notebooks/index.qmd)
