    "# Introduction: Role of Dust in the Earth System\n",
    "\n",
    "The land, ocean, and atmosphere are all parts of the Earth system, and they are linked and influence each other in many ways. One important link is the atmosphere carrying dust, gases, and pollution between continents and from land to ocean. A great example of this connection are massive dust plumes that originate in the Sahara Desert of northern Africa. These dust plumes can travel thousands of kilometers across the Atlantic Ocean and often reach the Americas. Dust from these plumes eventually reaches the ground, either by falling through the air or being brought down by rain, and contains nutrients such as phosphorus and iron. Phosphorus deposited by dust nourishes rainforests in Central and South America. Over the Atlantic, iron is thought to help phytoplankton—microscopic, plant-like organisms that live in the ocean and produce oxygen through photosynthesis—grow rapidly and in large quantities. These tiny but mighty organisms form the first link in the large ocean food chain, sustaining fish and other marine life.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent studies suggest that dust falling into remote parts of the Tropical North Atlantic Ocean (TNAO) can affect tuna migration, and, in turn, fishery-dependent economies in nearby regions, including the United States (Map 1). However, our analysis using NASA Earth observation datasets shows that the effect of dust deposition on phytoplankton in the TNAO may be more complex than previously understood."

    "# Understanding the Way Dust Connects Land, Ocean, and Life Through NASA Earth Observing Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of NASA satellite observations and models help scientists explore the complex interactions between land and ocean that are influenced by dust. NASA's MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), an Earth-observing satellite sensor, detects these changes by measuring ocean chlorophyll—a pigment that indicates the presence of phytoplankton. Additionally, NASA’s Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, launched in 2024, continues to monitor ocean biology through the amount of sunlight reflected back to space that may be affected by atmospheric dust or other aerosols.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While satellite sensors allow for monitoring both dust and phytoplankton activity, meteorological and dust transport variables are needed to analyze this interconnected relationship. NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) provides detailed, three-dimensional wind, temperature, moisture, and dust data, which is essential when determining the influences between dust transport and ocean productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The different meteorological variables that may impact and affect phytoplankton across the TNAO include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD): A measure of how much sunlight is blocked or scattered by aerosols (tiny particles in the atmosphere)\n",
    "Cloud Cover: Fraction or percentage of the sky covered by clouds\n",
    "Sea-Surface Temperatures (SST): The temperature at the top layer of the ocean\n",
    "Wind Speed: The rate at which the wind is moving on the ocean surface\n",
    "Dust Concentration: The amount of dust present in a volume of the atmosphere\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past 20 years, data has shown that chlorophyll-a levels – which is a direct indicator of phytoplankton – have been rising in the TNAO (Figure 1). The observed increase in phytoplankton compared to previous years alludes to a potential meteorological influence."

The fact that both aerosols and chlorophyll-a have increased together points to a possible connection: more dust blowing into the ocean may be helping fertilize the water, leading to more phytoplankton growth.\n",

    "Phytoplankton growth depends on many factors besides dust. Even when dust adds nutrients to the ocean, it doesn’t always lead to more phytoplankton if the water already has enough nutrients. In fact, dust in the air can block some sunlight from reaching the ocean surface, which can reduce photosynthesis and slow plankton growth. Clouds have a similar effect by cutting down the amount of sunlight.\n",

Normally, more clouds would limit the sunlight needed for photosynthesis, leading to less phytoplankton. But the steady rise in chlorophyll-a levels suggests that increased cloudiness and dust causing blocked sunlight has not been enough to hold back phytoplankton growth."

    "Although more cloud cover has shown an increasing trend over the past two decades, rainfall in this region has actually decreased over time. This decline in rain could be changing how dust gets deposited onto the ocean surface. Usually, rain helps wash dust out of the air—a process called wet deposition. But with less rain, more dust may be settling straight onto the ocean surface (dry deposition), bringing nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth. This change in how dust is delivered could help explain why chlorophyll-a levels keep rising despite more cloud cover.\n",

Warmer SSTs, on the other hand, often indicate less mixing and fewer nutrients reaching the surface.\n",

    "While dust over the TNAO has been increasing, other factors that affect phytoplankton growth have also been changing. Our statistical analysis using NASA Earth observation data \n",
    "products suggests that decreasing rainfall in the area of interest is an important factor in phytoplankton growth. It was also found that dust that directly falls onto the ocean surface is \n",
    "beneficial in phytoplankton growth, while dust that has been washed out by rain onto the ocean surface appears to have the opposite effect. This may be because in addition to depositing the dust, rain carries dissolved gases that could harm phytoplankton. While previous studies have documented rising trends in both dust and phytoplankton in this region, the role of decreasing rainfall—and the contrasting effects of dust falling directly into the ocean versus being washed out by rain—has received little attention. These findings point to new and important ways that land-atmosphere interactions can influence ocean biology, highlighting the need for continued investigation. However, note that this study uses an analysis of values averaged over a large area, which may hide complexities, and thus, further studies are needed.\n",

    "As the foundation of the marine food web, phytoplankton are critical to ocean biodiversity and the sustainability of global fisheries. These effects extend beyond the region; there are direct economic links to the United States. For instance, the U.S. imported nearly $30 million worth of seafood from Senegal alone in 2019—including tuna, mollusks, octopus, and shrimp—harvested from waters influenced by TNAO conditions (Map 3). Understanding the environmental drivers of phytoplankton productivity in this region is therefore essential not only for protecting local ecosystems but also for supporting global seafood supply chains that benefit U.S. consumers and markets. Understanding what drives phytoplankton productivity in the TNAO is essential for protecting local ecosystems and supporting seafood supply chains that benefit consumers worldwide."
