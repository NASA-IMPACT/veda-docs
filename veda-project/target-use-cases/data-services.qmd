## Goals

The goal of VEDA Data Services is to support open science through community standard tooling, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and providing access to persistent, discoverable Earth science datasets. This approach includes:

1. Making key datasets available in analysis-optimized formats
2. Tying together VEDA products by providing access to hosted data, existing third-party geospatial datasets, and new datasets produced within the VEDA ecosystem
4. Making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), within and also beyond VEDA
