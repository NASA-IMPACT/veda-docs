## Welcome {#welcome}

VEDA ([Visualization, Exploration and Data Analysis](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda)) is an innovative platform empowering researchers to explore and analyze Earth science data in the cloud. By combining interactive storytelling with open science principles, VEDA enables researchers to engage new audiences and share their analysis results effectively.

These pages provide documentation for onboarding users to cloud-enabled open science with Earth data, from computing and API usage to publication on the [VEDA Dashboard](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard).
