## Welcome {#welcome}

This website provides documentation and example notebooks for the various APIs, datasets and analytics platforms maintained by NASA VEDA project. The intended audience is anyone who plans to use those backend systems.

This website is based off [https://github.com/Openscapes/quarto-website-tutorial](https://github.com/Openscapes/quarto-website-tutorial).

## What is VEDA?

VEDA is NASA's Visualization, Exploration, and Data Analysis (VEDA) project. It is an open-source science cyberinfrastructure for data processing, visualization, exploration, and geographic information systems (GIS) capabilities.

Learn more at [https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda).

## What can you do with VEDA?

**Explore:** Available to anyone, you can visit the VEDA dashboard to explore data and stories developed by NASA scientific community at [https://earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard).

**Analyze:** Explore VEDA datasets and stories using a notebook environment. Follow the instructions on the [VEDA JupyterHub Access page](./veda-jh-access.qmd) to gain access to the environment. If you are a scientist affiliated with NASA projects such as [EIS](https://eis.smce.nasa.gov/about.html) and [MAAP](https://ops.maap-project.org) you should have access to a notebook environment associated with those projects.

## What's here
