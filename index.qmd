## Welcome {#welcome}

VEDA ([Visualization, Exploration and Data Analysis](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda)) is a redeployable data platform to support scientific visualization and analysis.
By combining interactive storytelling with open science principles, VEDA enables researchers to engage new audiences and share their analysis results effectively.

These docs help you use the services provided by the NASA VEDA Platform and learn about the open-source software ecosystem that it is based on.

## New to VEDA?

If you are just getting started with open-source geospatial data science (in Python) or want to learn more, you may find the [Collection of External Resources](/open-source-ecosystem/external-resources.qmd) useful.

To learn from examples, see the [VEDA Example Notebooks](/notebooks/index.qmd) - examples of open-source data science using VEDA services.

Selected user groups can also get access to a VEDA-provided [JupyterHub service](/nasa-veda-platform/scientific-computing/index.qmd).

Contributions of data, stories, and example code are open to all users affiliated with the project. We strive to make the process as easy as possible. Please see the docs on [Contributing](/nasa-veda-platform/adding-content/index.qmd).
