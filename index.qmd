## Welcome {#welcome}

NASA's [Visualization, Exploration, and Data Analysis (VEDA)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda) project promotes open science with Earth data, supporting the full circle of science communication and publication, exploration of the scientific methods and statistics behind results, and new cloud-enabled scientific analytics and automated data production.

These pages provide selected documentation for onboarding users to cloud-enabled open science with Earth data in a coding environment.

For data visualization and exploration in a graphical user interface, visit the [VEDA Dashboard](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard) that presents datasets and stories produced by the NASA scientific community.


## Interactive and Collaborative Data Science Environments

VEDA promotes the use of JupyterHub environments for interactive data science. Selected user groups can get access to a JupyterHub service provided by VEDA. Please find instructions for requesting access on the [VEDA JupyterHub Access page](./veda-jh-access.qmd).

If you are a scientist affiliated with NASA projects such as [EIS](https://eis.smce.nasa.gov/about.html) and [MAAP](https://ops.maap-project.org), you can also keep using the resources provided by these projects.

Through the use of [open-source technology](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/about), we make sure our services are interoperable and exchangeable.


## Resources for Open-Source Data Science

If you are just getting started with geospatial data science (in Python) or want to learn more, you may find the [Collection of External Resources](./external-resources.qmd) useful.

To learn from examples, see the [VEDA Example Notebooks](./example-notebooks/index.qmd) - examples of open-source data science using VEDA services.


## Data Services

In VEDA's open-source science environment, datasets can be discovered and accessed via open-standard data services such as a Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC) and WMTS map tiles APIs. Here is an [overview of the API endpoints](./veda-apis.qmd). Detailed docs to follow.
