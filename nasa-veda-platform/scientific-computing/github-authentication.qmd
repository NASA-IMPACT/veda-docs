title: How to push to GitHub from the VEDA JupyterHub
---

This is a quick how-to guide for pushing to GitHub from the VEDA JupyterHub.

## User authentication via veda-hub-github-scoped-creds app

### Copy notebook for running `gh-scoped-creds`


Copy the `/home/jovyan/veda-docs/notebooks/templates/template-github-auth.ipynb` notebook to your personal home directory on the Hub as `github-auth.ipynb`.

::: {.callout-tip}
You only need to do this step once.

### Authenticate to GitHub

::: {.callout-tip}
You need to do this step each time you create a new JupyterHub instance.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
This will only allow pushing to repositories that have been [configured with the veda-hub-github-scoped-creds-app]()
:::

These steps are also shown in the GIF below.

1. Open the `github-auth.ipynb` in your home directory.
2. Run the cell that contains `import gh_scoped_creds` followed by `%ghscopedcreds`.
3. Copy the code that was displayed in the cell output.
4. Navigate to [https://github.com/login/device/select_account](https://github.com/login/device/select_account).
5. Select the account that you want to authorize push access for.
6. Enter the code from the cell output in the Jupyter Notebook.
7. Select `Authorize veda-hub-github-scoped-creds`.

Now, you're all set! You should be able to push to the repositories that you configured in the first portion, as long as you're using the `https` rather than `ssh` protocol. You can set this up by selecting `https` when cloning the repository, or using `git remote set-url` to change from `ssh` to `https`.

## Repository admin configuration of the veda-hub-github-scoped-creds app

Repository admins need to configure the veda-hub-github-scoped-creds app to allow users to push from the JupyterHub.

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/apps/veda-hub-github-scoped-creds](https://github.com/apps/veda-hub-github-scoped-creds).
2. Select `Configure`.
3. Select the organization that contains the repository that you would like to push to.
4. Select either `All repositories` or `Only select repositories` depending on whether you only want to allow pushing to specific repositories. In order for a Hub user to write to those repositories, the repository needs to be added to the application **and** the user needs to have read/write permissions for the repository. The following restrictions define whether you can install the application yourself or if you need to request permission:
    - Organization owners can install GitHub Apps for all repositories.
    - Repository admins can install the application if they only grant access to repositories that they administer.
    - If you do not have sufficient permissions, GitHub will send a notification to the organization owner requesting that they install the app.
5. Click save.
