## About

Visualization Exploration and Data Analysis (VEDA) is an ecosystem of tools and services built with the goal to provide a redeployable and unified open-source science cyberinfrastructure for data processing, visualization, exploration, and GIS capabilities with NASA data on the cloud.

Developed through a collaboration between [NASA IMPACT](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov/), [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/), [University of Alabama in Huntsville](https://www.uah.edu/), [Element 84](https://www.element84.com/), [Georgia Institute of Technology (GT)](https://www.gatech.edu/), [International Interactive Computing Collaboration (2i2c)](https://2i2c.org), [Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esdis), [NASA Science Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE)](https://smce.nasa.gov/), and NASA Mission Cloud Platform (MCP), VEDA significantly reduces the barriers to accessing Earth science data and the computational resources needed for exploring and processing the petabyte-scale Earth data archives in the cloud. VEDA’s achievement exemplifies the core principles of NASA’s Open-Source Science Initiative (OSSI), showcasing commitment to promoting transparent, accessible, and collaborative scientific research.

## Goals
* Leverage existing open source components (NASA-MAAP, Dashboard, Cumulus, Pangeo, STAC, etc) to assemble interoperable ecosystem of tools
* Maximize the capabilities offered by data and compute on the cloud
* Provide services for future mission data processing
* Provide a platform for new priorities and directives: NASA’s Earth Action, NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program, and other priority initiatives

### Stakeholder Benefits
* General Public: Interactive stories
* Scientist: scientific (visual) analysis and communication
* Data producers/Researchers: processing and self publishing
* TOPS: summer schools and competitions
* Applied science/Decision makers: geospatial analysis and communication
* Communication: Interactive storytelling
