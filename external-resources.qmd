title: "External Resources"
subtitle: "Learn more about tools and practice open source geospatial data science - a list of external resources to get you started"
---

This list is intended for (aspiring) scientists who want to get started with cloud-based, collaborative, open geospatial data analysis, or those looking to refresh their knowledge. It is by no means complete, but contains pointers to more elaborate resources. We anticipate this list to evolve as our platform and use cases evolve. Suggestions for additional resources or topics are highly welcome.

## Master the basic workflow tools
* [Git - for managing code versions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
* [Conda - for managing dependencies](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
* [Jupyter - for running code](https://jupyter.org)

## Take a course or read a book on geospatial data analysis
* [Data Carpentry geospatial course](https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/)
* [UW course on Geospatial Data Analysis with Python](https://uwgda-jupyterbook.readthedocs.io/)
* [Geographic data book - emphasis on vector data](https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html)

## Look through nicely curated lists of tools and resources
* [Project Pythia - Pangeo's education hub](https://projectpythia.org/)
* [Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/overview/about)
* [Geospatial Computing Platform library of training resources (by Python package)](https://crib.utwente.nl/manual/training-resources/README.html)

## Find out what a Hack Week is and see how they teach best practice
* [UW GeoHackWeek](https://github.com/geohackweek)
