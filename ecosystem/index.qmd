The VEDA ecosystem of services provides a platform for
data products hosted in the VEDA data store and exposed via the [VEDA Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](http://veda-staging-stac-browser.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/).

The docs (this site) provide information about best practice in cloud-based Earth data science and platform-specific details about how to use and contribute information
on VEDA.
