subtitle: "Guide to ingesting and publishing data to the VEDA data store & STAC API"

VEDA uses a centralized [Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](https://stacspec.org/) for data dissemination and prefers to hosts datasets in cloud-object storage ([AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) in the region `us-west-2`) 
in the cloud-optimized file formats [Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)](https://www.cogeo.org/) and [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/), which enables viewing and efficient access in the cloud directly
from the original datafiles without copies or multiple versions.


## High-level steps

For dataset ingestion, generally four steps are required:

1. Transform datasets to conform with cloud-optimized file formats
2. Upload files to storage (may be skipped, if data is cloud-optimized and in `us-west-2`)
3. Create compliant metadata records for our STAC
4. Load those records into the VEDA STAC


## What do you need to do?

Depending on the capacity of the dataset provider, some of the steps can be completed by the VEDA team on request.

For every dataset ingest, please [open a dedicated Pull Request in the veda-data-pipelines repository](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-data-pipelines/issues/new?assignees=&labels=dataset&template=add-new-dataset-simple.md&title=Add+%3Cdataset+title%3E).

Complete as many steps of the process as you have capacity or authorization to. Please see the guides below on

1. How to prepare files and upload them to the VEDA data store - [Docs on file preparation](./file-preparation.qmd)
2. How to create metadata records and submit them to the catalog - [Docs on catalog ingestion](./catalog-ingestion.qmd)
