Once you have ingested a dataset into the VEDA backend (following the steps in [](./dataset-ingestion.qmd)), you will need to configure the Dashboard.

### Key Steps

1.  With the new dataset ingested, configure the dashboard to show this dataset using the [VEDA Configuration UI](https://visex.netlify.app/admin/#/collections/dataset).

2.  For more detailed instructions on this tool, visit [documentation within Github](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-config/blob/develop/docs/NETLIFY_CMS.md).

3.  After successfully configuring and previewing your dataset through the Configuration UI, your dataset configuration will still needs to be reviewed and confirmed by somebody on the VEDA team. Send an email to [veda@uah.edu](mailto:veda@uah.edu) with information about your dataset and a request for review.
