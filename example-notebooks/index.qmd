## Run

Every notebook contains information about how to run it. Some can run on [mybinder]https://mybinder.org/) and all can run on the VEDA JupyterHub.

See (VEDA Analytics JupyterHub Access)[https://nasa-impact.github.io/veda-docs/veda-jh-access.html] for information about how to gain access.

### Run outside the Hub

To run the notebooks locally, you can use a python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

Use an underscore to prefix your virtual environment so quarto doesn't render any contents of the virtual environment directory.

```bash
python3 -m venv _env
source _env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=_env
jupyter notebook
```

If the notebook needs access to protected data on S3, you will need to specifically get access. Please request access by emailing aimee@developmentseed.org or alexandra@developmentseed.org and providing your affiliation, interest in or expected use of the dataset and an AWS IAM role or user Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

## Generate a "Run on VEDA" link

We use [`nbgitpuller`](https://hub.jupyter.org/nbgitpuller/) links to open the VEDA JupyterHub with a particular notebook pulled in. These links have the form: `https://nasa-veda.2i2c.cloud/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-docs&urlpath=lab/tree/veda-docs/example-notebooks/open-and-plot.ipynb&branch=main`

If you are writing a notebook and want to share it with others you can generate your own `nbgitpuller` link using this
[link generator](https://hub.jupyter.org/nbgitpuller/link?hub=https://nasa-veda.2i2c.cloud&repo=https://github.com/NASA-impact/veda-docs&branch=main&app=jupyterlab).
