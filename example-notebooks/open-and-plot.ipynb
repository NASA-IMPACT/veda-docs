    "## About the data\n",
    "    \n",
    "CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) uses 15 variables at the census tract level. The data comes from the U.S. decennial census for the years 2000 & 2010, and the American Community Survey (ACS) for the years 2014, 2016, and 2018. It is a hierarchical additive index (Tate, 2013), with the component elements of CDC’s SVI including the following for 4 themes: Socioeconomic Status, Household Composition & Disability, Minority Status & Language, and Housing Type & Transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S. Census tract–subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. SVI ranks the tracts on 15 social factors, including unemployment, minority status, and disability, and further groups them into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scientific research\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVI Overall Score provides the overall, summed social vulnerability score for a given tract. The Overall Score SVI Grid is part of the U.S. Census Grids collection, and displays the Center for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) SVI score. Funding for the final development, processing and dissemination of this data set by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) was provided under the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Overall SVI Score describes the vulnerability in a given county tract based on the combined percentile ranking of the four SVI scores (Socioeconomic Status, Household Composition & Disability, Minority Status & Language, and Housing Type & Transportation). The summed percentile ranking from the four themes is ordered, and then used to calculate an overall percentile ranking, ranging from 0 (less vulnerable) to 1 (more vulnerable)². Tracts with higher Overall SVI Scores typically rank high in other SVI domains, and reveal communities that may require extra support, resources, and preventative care in order to better prepare for and manage emergency situations.\n",
