## Services

The Data Services on the NASA VEDA platform are:

* [VEDA Data Store](data-store.qmd): selected data products in Analysis Ready Cloud-Optimized (ARCO) formats
* [Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](https://openveda.cloud): catalog for datasets exposed on the [NASA Earthdata VEDA platform](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/) and partner platforms
* [Data access APIs](apis/index.qmd)
* [Data transformation & publication services](data-ingestion.qmd): services for data transformation, ingestion and publication to the VEDA data catalog

A technical architecture diagram of how all of these work together can be found in the [software architecture description](/open-source-ecosystem/architecture.qmd).
