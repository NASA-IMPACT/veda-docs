# Using the VEDA Dashboard in Your Own Projects

VEDA provides the software architecture for an **open, accessible, and powerful platform** to help science teams communicate insights hidden in large-scale geospatial data.

- Built to work with **cloud-optimized formats** like [COG](https://cogeo.org/) and the emerging web-optimized [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/).
- Enables rapid, compelling storytelling at scale.
- Open-source under permissive licenses to encourage broad use and innovation.

Our goal is to lower the barriers to entry for scientists to talk about their work, for users to learn about and explore geospatial data, and for geospatial data to come alive in ways it never has before. 

Whether you want a turnkey dashboard, individual components, or a foundation for your own innovation, we want the VEDA Dashboard to be flexible and modular enough for your needs.

As the number of projects that depend on VEDA grows, we want to make it straightforward for organizations outside of NASA to use and extend these tools. If you have any feedback on the tools or your ability to use them, please reach out to veda@uah.edu

This document shares guidance on how you can adopt the VEDA Dashboard in a way that fits your needs.

## Getting Started

If you are going to use the VEDA Dashboard for your own purposes, we assume that you will be self-hosting your own website and data. 
- That website and data could all be VEDA tools, so if you're starting from scratch, don't worry! Visit the [top-level instructions](open-source-ecosystem/creating-your-own-instance/index.qmd) for using VEDA.

The primary repository for the VEDA Dashboard is here: 
- [veda-ui Github](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-ui)

We have created a Template Dashboard to showcase how you can pull in veda-ui and create a website compiled with NextJS. 
You can explore and review that implementation here:
- [Template Dashboard GitHub](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/next-veda-ui)
That Template Dashboard is live here:
- [Template Dashboard](https://veda-ui-next-test.netlify.app/)

## Choosing Your Path: How to Use VEDA

Depending on your goals and technical preferences, there are three main ways to leverage the VEDA Dashboard:

### You don't already have a website for your project, or want the full VEDA Dashboard

#### Clone the Template Dashboard

In this case, we recommend **manually cloning** the [Template Dashboard GitHub](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/next-veda-ui) repository. This will allow you to adjust styling, add any custom features, and manage your own content. 

- This approach gives you full control and flexibility
- Benefit from updates to core VEDA functionality

**When to choose this:**

- You value simplicity and speed.
- You are also using other VEDA tools and patterns, such as STAC and eoAPI.
- You don't already have a web presence for your project, or you are interested in completely replacing your current website

### You already have a website, and want to include parts of the VEDA Dashboard

#### Use VEDA as an NPM Package (for Component Integration)

If you already have a robust web presence but want to use VEDA's powerful **tools** and **widgets**â€”such as data stories or analysis tools, then you can simply import them as an NPM package.

- Allows you to selectively integrate VEDA components into your existing site.
- Take advantage of novel storytelling and COG (Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF) capabilities without a full rebuild.

**When to choose this:**

- You want to enhance your existing website
- You already have a preferred CMS tool for managing your site

## Content Management Options

The VEDA Dashboard is designed for content to be **easily managed**.

- **Default:** Content is stored in simple, human-readable **MDX files**. Editors can write, edit, and customize pages directly.
- **Optional:** We have prototyped an integration with [Strapi CMS](https://strapi.io/), providing a more familiar, GUI-based editing experience for non-technical users.
- **Flexible:** We have extended the [MDX Editor](https://mdxeditor.dev/) to allow customization and story editing directly within your existing CMS or backend platform.

This flexibility ensures that both technical and non-technical teams can collaborate seamlessly.
