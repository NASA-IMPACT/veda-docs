## The Ecosystem

Below are resources for prospective platform providers and contributors to the open source ecosystem that VEDA leverages to provide science data platforms.

* [Software architecture](./architecture.qmd)
* [Code repositories of redeployable software components](./repositories.qmd)
* [External resources for learning and reference](./external-resources.qmd)

If you are interested in setting up your own platform based on VEDA open-source software, please email the VEDA team at veda@uah.edu and we will provide further direction.
