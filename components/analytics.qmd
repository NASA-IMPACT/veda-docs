subtitle: A resource to develop (interactively) and execute (operationally) algorithms for geospatial data science and scalable computing
---

The goal of the VEDA Analytics Platform (AP) is to provide scientists the resources they need to develop (interactively) and execute (operationally) algorithms for geospatial data science and scalable computing, and to support open science by giving all users access to sufficient resources and tools to do science and replicate scientific results. This approach includes:

* Identifying and configuring interactive, collaborative science environments (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) for advanced data exploration and prototyping new products
* Providing frameworks for cloud-native simulation modeling and data assimilation
* Improving technologies for dynamic scaling and operationalization of product generation workflows
* Providing managed resources for data analysis in the cloud
