The [VEDA Dashboard](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/) is one of several user interfaces in the VEDA project. The VEDA Dashboard is a publishing platform for results of scientific analysis of Earth data at NASA, 
in the form of Dataset information pages ("Datasets") and stories ("Discoveries").

It also is aligned with VEDA's goal of advancing interactive visualization and exploratory visual data analysis. This dashboard constitutes:

* an evolution of COVID-19 dashboard to provide the interactive storytelling for various environmental changes using Earth observation data;
* a transformation of high-valued NASA datasets to dynamic visualization, enabling users to perform on-the-fly visual analysis; support for environmental justice initiatives through the integration of NASA Earth observation data and socio-economic data;
* a tool by which users can visually explore and localize data, and perform independent analysis; data-driven stories that are exportable in multiple formats; and a situational awareness system that brings together Earth observation datasets such as greenhouse gasses, air quality, and sea level rise, among others.
