You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username).\nFirst, choose an existing website to copy. The simplest option is to start with this site: quarto-website-tutorial.\nOther options of potential interest:\n\n2021-Cloud-Hackathon\n2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop\nOpenscapes Approach-Guide\n\nNext, follow these steps to fork and setup your repo with GitHub Actions from Gavin Fay, using the repo you chose. These instructions will take ~5 minutes.\nNow you’ve got a copy of your repo of choice in your own GitHub account, and you’re set to start making your own edits. Your GitHub repo is set up with a GitHub Action that will use Quarto to rebuild and republish your site anytime you make a commit: committing will trigger the GitHub Action to rebuild and republish the book.\nNote that the GitHub Action for this book does not include R or Python so those will need to be added if your website relies on code. See https://github.com/r-lib/actions for more details and examples.\n\nDownload instead of fork\nForking might not always be the way to go - you can’t fork into the same GitHub user account or organization so if for example you want to make a copy of 2021-Cloud-Hackathon repo within the same NASA-Openscapes GitHub Organization, you’ll need to download instead of fork. In this case, follow these steps to download and copy into a new repository, and set up the GitHub Action separately.\n\nDownload github repo files\nNavigate to https://github.com/openscapes/quarto-website-tutorial (or any other quarto site repo of choice). Click the green “Code” button and select “Download ZIP”. When it downloads on your computer, unzip the files.\n\n\nCreate a new GitHub repo\nNavigate to your GitHub account or organization, and create a new repository, naming it what you’d like. You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username). When you’re logged in, github.com will show a green button that says “New” which you’ll also see as you navigate to your username’s repository page.\n\n\nAdd original site files\nTo use the GitHub file uploader, click the button next to the green “Code” button that says “Add file”. Add file > Upload files. Then, on your computer, select all the files in unzipped folder (command-A or control-A), and drag them to the GitHub uploader page. Scroll down to write a commit message, which effectively saves your files when you’re working in the browser.\nNote: if you’re comfortable cloning the new repository and copying files into it locally before committing and pushing back to GitHub, that can be preferable to the uploader, which does have limitations with complex repos (although the uploader works fine with this tutorial repo)."

    "text": "Bookdown to Quarto\nConverting a Bookdown book to Quarto is slightly more involved than converting a website. A book has chapters whose order must be defined, and likely has citations and cross-refs. Still, conversion is not that hard.\nWe got some practice converting from Bookdown to Quarto by helping Gavin Fay convert his lab’s fantastic onboarding documentation, the Faylab Lab Manual. Here’s the GitHub view before and after.\nOur best first reference material for this was Nick Tierney’s Notes on Changing from Rmarkdown/Bookdown to Quarto. Nick shares some scripts in that post to automate some changes. In our case, the book was small enough that we made all changes manually. Quarto documentation was indispensable.\n\nExperimenting in a low-risk environment\nWe forked a copy of the Faylab Lab manual to the Openscapes organization, and worked in a branch so we could make changes relatively risk-free. We could always fork a new copy of the original if we “broke” something. (Caution: the default when making a pull request from a fork is to push changes to the original upstream repo, not your fork and it does this without warning if you have write-access to that repo.) With local previews it’s easy to test / play with settings to see what they do. We tended to make a change, Preview, then compare the look and functionality of the book to the original. It was helpful to comment out some elements of the configuration file _output.yml after their counterparts had been added to the Quarto configuration file _quarto.yml, or to confirm they were no longer needed, before making the drastic move of deleting them.\n\n\nThe conversion\nHere are the main steps to convert the Faylab Lab manual from Bookdown to Quarto.\nCreate new empty file called _quarto.yml and add book metadata there. The screenshots below\nSet project type as book.\nMove metadata out of index.qmd and into _quarto.yml. Title, author, and publication date were in index.qmd with date set using date: \"Last updated:r Sys.Date()\". Now these are in _quarto.yml with date set using date: last-modified. Note that having R code would require you to adjust code chunk options in the Quarto style (#|). This tripped us up a bit; see GitHub Actions.\nMove chapters listing out of _bookdown.yml and into _quarto.yml.\nAdd page footer to _quarto.yml.\nHere’s what ours looked like when we finished the steps above (_quarto.yml).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaylab Lab Manual\n\n\n\n\n\nChange insertion of images from html style to Quarto style. (Note Quarto calls them “figures”, not “images”.) The following snippet will insert the GitHub octocat logo in a page:\n![](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png){fig-align=\"left\" width=\"35px\"}\nChange all filename extensions .Rmd -> .qmd (you could Preview after this change and see that the book looks the same). Note that Quarto works with .Rmd files just as well as it does .qmd, so this change is not urgent. In fact, if you have a lot of R code in your .Rmds (unlike the Faylab Lab Manual), there will be additional tinkering needed to make the code chunks happy.\n\n\nCitations\nThe Faylab Lab Manual cited two papers, presenting us with an opportunity to see how easy it is to add references to a Quarto book. Briefly, in the Visual Editor, Insert > Citation > DOI. Pasting the DOI or its full URL, we can insert the citation. This automatically creates a references.bib file and adds the full citations at the bottom of the chapter page (watch demo). In July 2022, we had to manually add a ## References heading, but this may not be necessary in future Quarto updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert citation via its DOI using RStudio Visual Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing notes\nIf the book’s output is strictly html, there’s no need to specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _book/, which is what we’d like. If we wanted other types of output like like PDF or EPUB, etc. those single file outputs are also written to the output-dir (Quarto docs).\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder, delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _book/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_book/\nOnce all is settled, delete _output.yml.\nOnce the Openscapes fork was fully reviewed, we made a pull request from that to the main branch of the book’s repo. Once that was merged, we set up GitHub Actions to render the book. (TODO: instructions for GitHub Actions)\n\n\nGitHub Actions\nThis book was mostly prose and screenshots without any R code. This made the conversion from RMarkdown to Quarto likely more straightforward than if you also needed to adjust code chunk options in the quarto style (#|). Our initial GitHub Action to render the converted Faylab Lab Manual failed because we had a piece of R code - even though the code was commented out! This was resolved when we deleted the line."

We followed excellent notes and examples from Nick Tierney and Danielle Navarro.\nAfter we had changed all the files, the Build tab in the RStudio IDE still showed “Build website” rather then “Render Website” and “Preview Website”, and would error when we pushed them (because that button was expecting a distill site, not a quarto site). To fix this, we updated the .Rproj file. Clicking on the .Rproj file in the RStudio IDE will open a dialog box where you can click things you want (you can also open these in a text editor or from the GitHub website to see the actual text). To fix this situation with the Build tab: Project Options > Build Tools > Project Build Tools > None.\nLooking at files /posts/_metadata.yml and _quarto.yml helps see where things are defined. For example, to make event post citations appear, we added citation: true to /posts/_metadata.yml and in _quarto.yml under the website key we set site-url: https://openscapes.github.io/events. We deleted footer.html used with distill because footer is now defined in quarto.yml.\n\nPublishing notes\n\nBackground: Our distill site had been set up to output to a docs folder, and had GitHub Settings > Pages set to look there rather gh-pages branch. (Julie note: this was a new-to-me capability when we set up the events distill site in Spring 2021 so I had forgotten that was an option). We’ve inititally kept this same set-up for now with our events page in _quarto.yml: output-dir: docs. However, this is sub-optimal; better to not have to commit and push these files but to instead have a GitHub Action generate them upon a commit. So the following is what we did -\n\nDon’t specify output-dir in _quarto.yml. The output directory default is _site/, which is what we’d like.\nIf you currently have a docs/ folder (like we did as we were experimenting), delete it.\nUpdate .gitignore to ignore _site/. At the same time, we have it ignore caches and a .quarto file:\n/.quarto/\n*_cache/\n_site/\nPush these changes, merge into main.\nOn GitHub.com, in your repo, set up GitHub publishing\nFollow instructions from the explore and setup chapter."

We need three dashes --- on separate lines preceding and following the title:, which you can name as you’d like.\n---\ntitle: Python Example\n---\n\n\nSecond chunk: Markdown\nLet’s add a new chunk that is Markdown so we can write some description of what this page will be.\nClick the + symbol at the top of the document, and this will add a new chunk, which by default again is a Code chunk. Change it to a Markdown Chunk following the steps we did above when switching to Raw.\nHere, write a little bit of text in Markdown. Since your title is effectively a level-1 header, avoid using level-1 headers in the rest of your document. Here is some example text I wrote:\n## Introduction\n\nThis example has some Python code that will be a part of our Quarto site.\n\n\nThird chunk: Code\nNow let’s create a new chunk with the default Code setting.\nPaste the following code (or write some of your own to test):\n#| label: fig-polar\n#| fig-cap: \"A line plot on a polar axis\"\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\nNow, go ahead and execute this code chunk like you normally would, by clicking the cursor in a code block and clicking the sideways “play” triangle to run the selected cells (and advance to the next cell). This code produces a plot.\nNote that the code runs as it normally would; the code options in the comments are just comments.\n\n\nSave your file\nSave your document - I’ll call mine python-example.ipynb in the main repository."

This takes about 20 minutes. (For an even more detailed walk-through, see Allison Horst’s ESM 206 Google Doc).\n\n\nClone your repo\nYou’ll start by cloning your repository into RStudio.\nFile > New Project > Version Control > Git > paste your repository name.\nR for Excel Users: Clone your repository using RStudio has detailed instructions and screenshots of these steps.\n\n\nInstall Quarto\nNext, you’ll install Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/. After downloading, follow the installation wizard on your computer. When it is complete, you won’t see an application or any new software, but it is now available to RStudio (as well as all other applications on your computer, including the command line).\n\n\nRStudio orientation\nNow let’s take a moment to get oriented. This is an RStudio project, which is indicated in the top-right. The bottom right pane shows all the files in your project; everything we’ve cloned from GitHub. We can open any RStudio project by opening its .Rproj file, or from RStudio File > Open Project ….\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the project name and files pane\n\n\n\n\nVisual Editor\nThe RStudio Visual Editor is quite new and has features that improve your writing experience. Working in the Visual Editor feels a bit like working in a Google Doc.\nHere’s an example showing the same file in the original Source Editor with content in markdown format and in the Visual Editor with content that looks more like it will appear in a live site. You can switch freely between these modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the Source Editor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the Visual Editor\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready have some content formatted in a Google Doc? You can copy-paste it into the Visual Editor and most formatting will be retained.\nThe editing bar provides familiar point and click access to text formatting options like bulleted or numbered lists.\n\n\n\nRStudio IDE highlighting the point and click editing bar\n\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThe Visual Editor also lets you use many keyboard shortcuts that might be familiar for adding boldface (command-b), italics (command-i), or headers. On a Mac, option-command-2 will make a level 2 header. Try it with option-command-1, or option-command-0 for normal text!\n\n\nInsert an image or figure\nTo insert an image (called a figure in Quarto), click the image icon. This brings up a window in which we can select the image, set its alignment, give it a caption and alt text, hyperlink it, or edit other metadata.\n\n\n\nInsert image or figure using the Visual Editor\n\n\nOnce an image is added, clicking on that image gives us editing options. We can resize it dynamically by clicking in the image and dragging a corner or side to resize. When an image is selected, its dimensions are displayed for editing. Clicking on the gray ellipsis to the right of the dimensions opens the pop-up window to access more metadata edits.\n\n\nInsert a table\nSimilar to adding an image, to insert a table, we click the Table dropdown."

This will open this markdown file in a fourth pane; the editor pane. Make a small change, for example change to today’s date on Line 4. Then, save your file; there is a disc icon at the top of the file.\nThen, render this file: press “Render” which is to the right of the disc icon that saves the file.

You’ll be able to shift the arrangement of webpages by reordering/adding/deleting them in the _quarto.yml file following the patterns you see in this example.\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml and website side-by-side\n\n\nNotice that there are multiple ways in the _quarto.yml for you to include a file in your website. For example, in the above image, the “First Observations” we see in the left sidebar of the published website (right image) is represented in _quarto.yml (left image) over two lines, with line 36 indicating the file reference and line 37 indicating the text to show up in the left sidebar. However, “From RStudio” is only represented in one line of _quarto.yml, on line 43. This represents two strategies for including a file in your website. By default, the title of a specified file will show up in the website’s sidebar, which is what is happening with the “From RStudio” example. If you would like more control over what is written in the sidebar vs the title of your files, then the approach we took with “First Observations” is what you’ll want to do: you’ll see that only “First Observations” shows up in the sidebar as we specified in _quarto.yml, but the page’s title says “First Observations & Setup” (which in our preference was too long for the sidebar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs you modify _quarto.yml, the most important thing to know is that spacing matters. Pay attention to whether text is indented by one, two, four, or other spaces, and make sure you follow it; if your site is not looking as expected it is likely a silent error in your YAML. Some text editors like RStudio provide debugging support for YAML and are highly recommended to save you time and heartache."
