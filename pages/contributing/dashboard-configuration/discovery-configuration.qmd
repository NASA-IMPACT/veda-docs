By this point, you should have a few things:

1.  A draft of a Discovery that you want to show in VEDA
2.  Necessary datasets identified, and ideally already ingested in to VEDA
3.  Images, csv files, or any other supporting assets prepared


üßë‚Äçüè´ We recommend you follow the [video walkthrough](#sec-video-walkthrough) on how to setup a virtual environment to facilitate discovery creation.

### Key Steps

1. Go to the [veda-config](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-config) repo in Github

2. If using a local environment:

    1. Familiarize yourself with the [Setup](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-config/blob/develop/docs/SETUP.md) and [Configuration](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-ui/blob/main/docs/content/CONFIGURATION.md) sections of the documentation

    2. Using your local environment, create a branch for your Discovery

    3. Following the guidelines outlined in the [Content](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-ui/blob/main/docs/content/CONTENT.md) section of the Github documentation, create your discovery mdx file

    4. Add relevant files and assets as needed

    5. Push your branch and create a pull request in Github

3. If configuring through Github

    1. Create a new branch for the discovery

       ![Branching on GitHub](https://res.cloudinary.com/almanac/image/upload/v1678300216/workspace_portal_uploads/hw7elccu5sil1sy2qu4c.png)

       Following the guidelines outlined in the [Content](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-ui/blob/main/docs/content/CONTENT.md) section of the Github documentation, create your discovery mdx file

    2. Add relevant files and assets as needed

    3.  Commit your changes and open a Pull Request


4. Once the pull request is created, you will be able to see a preview of the Discovery in a Netlify box under the Conversation tab of the pull request

    üçÄ You don't have to fully finish your Discovery all in one go. Every time you make a commit the preview will be regenerated with your changes (takes about 3 minutes).

5. Once you feel good about the Discovery, add the VEDA team as reviewers to your pull request

    1. If you know who you want to review, add them

    2. Otherwise, here as some good GitHub handles to start with: @hanbyul-here, @danielfdsilva, @aboydnw

6. Paste a comment in the pull request with any additional information, such as any goal dates for publishing this discovery or any outstanding questions you have

7. Once the pull request is merged, the files will still need to be pushed to production. Coordinate with Anthony Boyd on this production push
