# Welcome to the NASA VEDA Documentation

[VEDA (Visualization, Exploration and Data Analysis)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda) is a redeployable data platform to support scientific 
visualization and analysis. By combining interactive storytelling with open science principles, VEDA enables researchers to engage new audiences and 
share their analysis results effectively.

These docs help you use the services provided by the NASA VEDA Platform and learn about the open-source software ecosystem that it is based on.
